🧵 CraftConnect – Voice-First AI Marketplace for Rural Artisans

CraftConnect is a voice-first, AI-powered e-commerce platform built to make online selling accessible for rural artisans.
It enables artisans to upload products using voice + a single photo, while AI automatically generates professional listings, enhanced images, and fair pricing — eliminating middlemen and increasing artisan income.

Challenge Statement: Making E-Commerce Accessible for Rural Artisans Using AI

🚨 Problem Statement
Millions of rural artisans in India create high-quality handmade products but struggle to earn a fair income due to:

Dependence on middlemen (80–90% profit loss)
Low digital literacy and English-only platforms
Inability to create professional product listings
Poor product images and no pricing guidance
As a result, over 200+ million artisans remain digitally excluded, earning below the poverty line despite high skill levels.

💡 Solution Overview
CraftConnect removes these barriers through voice-first AI automation:

Artisans speak in their own language
Upload one photo + voice description
AI generates:
SEO-ready product titles & descriptions
Enhanced, professional product images
Fair price recommendations
Products go live in minutes — no typing, no English, no middlemen

🔁 Conceptual Workflow (Artisan Upload)
Artisan opens app and speaks: “Upload new product”
Takes a single photo of the product
AI enhances the image (background removal, clarity)
Artisan gives short voice description
AI generates:
Product title
Detailed description
Tags & translations
Add Pricing
Voice confirmation → product goes live
